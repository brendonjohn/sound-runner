#sound-runner

I'm exploring clojurescript and the ecosystem around it. I quite enjoy what I've learnt so far so I've decided to build a tiny game to further my progress and understanding.

Sound-runner is supposed to be a light-weight game you to play while you listen to music via the soundcloud api. There currently isn't any sound or running, so the name really is misleading.

See it working: http://brendonjohn.github.io/sound-runner/

##technology

- clojurescript
- om
- core.async

##lets see it

- clone the repo
- cd into the repo
- bower install

- python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- open up 127.0.0.1:8000 with your browser


##What do you think?
I like using om to work with the dom. I don't really want to continue building a game, but as far as composing web applications, I will be reading into om and the surrounding technologies much more


##license?
